# Basic Bounce Engine

This Engine is purely meant to be a form of visual learning, it is extremely basic and should not be used for serious development in any way. It is recommended that any code you wish to try in this environment be written in ```main.cpp```, and that only the header files (```*.h```) be referenced.
