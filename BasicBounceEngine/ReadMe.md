# Basic Bounce Engine

This Engine is purely meant to be a form of visual learning, it is extremely basic and should not be used for serious development in any way. It is recommended that any code you wish to try in this environment be written in ```main.cpp```, and that only the header files (```*.h```) be referenced.

Additionally, there are exercises here (much like those under lessons) for those that prefer visual feedback when writing data structures. These use the solution by default, but can be changed to use your code in the header file (after the class declaration).
