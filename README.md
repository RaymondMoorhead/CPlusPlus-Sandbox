A C++ tutorial and sandbox

The lessons and engine use premake5 to create a Visual Studio 2019 solution.

The code has been tested only within x64 Windows 7 and x64 Windows 10 environments. The lessons will probably compile and run fine on most systems, but the BasicBounceEngine has dependencies with 'glew' and 'glfw' that have been satisfied with libraries generated specifically for 64 bit Windows systems.
