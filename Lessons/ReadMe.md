These lessons have been written with the assumption that the reder has a firm understanding of Java, and thus mainly focuses on bridging the gaps between Java and C++ instead of starting from scratch. Thus a reader should already know primitive types, classes, method signatures, the main method, arrays, ArrayLists, and the Object Oriented Programming principles.

The lessons are all part of a single solution, to prevent redefinition errors some files have been removed from compilation with the ```#if 0``` preprocessor command. To enable this code you must change it to ```#if 1```, and be careful to remove any conflicting definitions.

The lessons and exercises are numbered starting from 0, the naming convention being ```##_Name``` for the main lesson, and ```##_#_Name``` for supplementary files for the same lesson.
